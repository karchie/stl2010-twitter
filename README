This is a simple tweet miner, built at (and after) an impromptu
session at Strange Loop 2010. Note that this version uses ONLY
tweets that have a to_user, which is a pretty small subset, so the
graph is smaller and sparser than the one you'll find here:

Someday this code should be fixed to extract user references from the
message text instead.

To use:

1. Install Leiningen (http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).
   You'll also need protovis (http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis)
   installed as ../protovis-3.2 to view the output graph.

2. Build:
   lein uberjar

  (Leiningen has been a little cranky for me -- I usually use Maven
   for builds. I used lein here because it's supposedly simpler and
   more clojure-y, but I'm still not impressed. If lein uberjar fails,
   try it again. No, really, just enter the same command again, a few
   times if necessary. Eventually it will probably work.)

3. Run:
   java -jar stl2010-0.1.0-standalone.jar network.js

This generates the network data as a javascript document. Open
vis-tweets.html to see the result.
